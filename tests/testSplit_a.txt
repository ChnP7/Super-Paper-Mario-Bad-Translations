where is the library at?
We were in a shop and on the
wall there was a Po doggy 
on the wall. I tried
to screenshot it <ioe>

But it was too late. 
Nah its not working with 
notifications. Lets jam
to some music! Lets do it.
It'll be a lot of fun.

How long does it take to get to
a long character limit? I want
to hit at least 3,000 characters
so that I can properly test the
functionality of split, which
splits about every 3,250 characters
or so (unless I decide to change it)
and also, <this_is_a_test> <is_that_right>
<placeholder><placeholder><placeholder><placeholder><placeholder><k><placeholder><NUL>
How many characters are we at now? No idea.
Wow, I just checked. Only reaching 800 at
this point. This takes quite a while
honestly. Mannnnnn this is very tedious.
I shall copy and paste what I have above to
increase the character count.

O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion
A home and a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,

And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,”
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
